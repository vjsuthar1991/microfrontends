# Microfrontend Application with Webpack Module Federation

This repository contains a microfrontend architecture implemented using the Webpack Module Federation plugin. It demonstrates how to build a scalable and maintainable application by splitting it into multiple smaller, independently deployable modules.

## Introduction

Microfrontends are a design pattern where a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "micro" apps working loosely together. This project utilizes Webpack's Module Federation plugin to achieve this architecture, allowing for dynamic imports and sharing of dependencies.

## Architecture

The application is divided into multiple microfrontends:

- **Container**: The host application that loads other microfrontends.
- **Microfrontend1**: An example microfrontend.
- **Microfrontend2**: Another example microfrontend.

Each microfrontend is independently deployable and can be developed and tested in isolation.

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vjsuthar1991/microfrontends.git
cd microfrontends/shopping-app
```

## Running the Application

Each microfrontend can be started independently. In separate terminal windows, navigate to each microfrontend's directory and run the following command:

```bash
# In the container directory
cd container
npm install
npm start

# In the cart directory
cd cart
npm install
npm start

# In the products directory
cd products
npm install
npm start
```

By default, the applications will be available at the following URLs:

- Container: http://localhost:3000
- Cart: http://localhost:3001
- Products: http://localhost:3002

The container will load the microfrontends dynamically.

## Development

To develop a microfrontend, navigate to its directory and use the following commands:

```bash
cd cart
npm start
```

This will start a development server with hot module replacement enabled, making it easy to develop and test your microfrontend in isolation.

This will create optimized bundles in the `dist` directory of each microfrontend.
